Backup Team Drives

Using Google App Scripts, this script will copy all files in all team folders that the signed in user has access to. 

Details:

* all team folders that the user has access to will be copied to the specified backup team drive.
* the specified backup team drive will not be backed up.
* all google format files are converted to office style formats, so the document is available off line.
* when run again, the previous backups of the team folders are removed, so only one copy is kept.
* It is recommended to use Google Stream Desktop to obtain local versions of the backup team drive.
